# Precious Smith

I’m passionate about using data to solve complex problems. I believe in quality and excellence and thrive when I’m a part of finding solutions that improve company systems and the quality of life for customers. My experience working with people who are unable to clearly communicate their needs has taught me to look for underlying clues and what’s not being said to ask the best questions and find the strongest solutions.
