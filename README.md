# Precious Smith

I'm a Data Scientist who's passionate about finding solutions to complex problems. I use data analytics and machine learning techniques to draw clear insights from large, messy data and realize value for stakeholders. I believe in delivering quality and excellence in all I do and thrive knowing my efforts positively impact business solutions. My experience working with people who are unable to clearly communicate their needs has taught me to look for underlying clues and whatâ€™s not being said to ask the best questions and find the strongest solutions.
